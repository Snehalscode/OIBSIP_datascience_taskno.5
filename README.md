Sales Prediction Project
Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts future sales of a product or service based on factors such as advertising spend, customer segments, and marketing platforms. This helps businesses optimize their advertising strategies and allocate budgets effectively.

Steps Performed
Data Collection: Gathered sales and advertising data, including features like advertising budget, customer segments, and platforms used.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned data for missing or inconsistent values, encoded categorical variables into numeric formats, and scaled/normalized numerical features if necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explored relationships between sales and advertising factors using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Feature Engineering: Created new features (e.g., total ad spend, segment dummies) to enhance model performance.

Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate model generalization.

Model Building: Trained regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict sales values. Performed hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.

Model Evaluation: Assessed models using metrics like R² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Selected the best-performing model.

Prediction & Interpretation: Predicted sales on new data and interpreted key factors influencing sales performance.

Tools Used
Python 3.x

pandas — for data manipulation and preprocessing

scikit-learn — for modeling and evaluation

matplotlib and seaborn — for data visualization

numpy — for numerical computations

XGBoost or GradientBoostingRegressor (optional) — for advanced regression models

Outcome
The model successfully predicts sales with high accuracy (typically R² above 90%), providing actionable insights into how advertising spend, targeted customer segments, and chosen marketing platforms influence sales. This empowers businesses to make data-driven marketing and budgeting decisions for improved revenue and efficiency.
